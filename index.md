# Minetest Mobs Mods

(just setting up!)

We are a group maintaining mods for [Minetest](https://minetest.net), an open source alternative to MineCraft-like games.

Specifically, our aim is to maintain mobs mods based on [tenplus1's `mobs_redo` mob engine](https://notabug.org/tenplus1/), keeping them in line with the upstream `mobs_redo` development. We aim to ensure mobs mods in the collection remain collectively compatible with the same version of `mobs_redo` as eachother, and that they can coexist in the same world as eachother.

## Submitting a mod

Mods should be submitted by their original creators ideally, though apparently-abandoned mods may be submitted too, [please open an Issue](https://github.com/minetest-mobs-mods/minetest-mobs-mods.github.io/issues) to make a submission

### Requirements for submission acceptance

* Mod must add mobs based on `mobs_redo` - this is the core intended maintenance expertise of the group
* Link to the mod's original online repository, or to where it can be downloaded
* Mod must be fully and properly licensed:
    * No home-grown licenses. Any non-OSI, non-GNU or non-CreativeCommons license should provide a link to the organisation that developed it. "Public domain" is not a license model that can be accepted.
    * Source code must be under a license that [meets OSI aproval](https://opensource.org/osd)
        * Any WTFPL-licensed code will be re-licensed under MIT-license, the closest OSI-approved license in keeping with the intent of WTFPL.
    * Multimedia items including textures, sounds and models, must be distributed under their own explicit license, which grants recipients the right to redistribute in turn.
        * typically [`CC-BY`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), although [`CC0`](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/) is also acceptable.
    * Any submitted mod that is improperly licensed but abandoned will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
